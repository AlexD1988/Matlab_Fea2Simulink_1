Matlab FEA to SIMULINK
========================================

Description
-----------

This is an adaptation of the bracket deformation described in the PDE Toolbox example from Mathworks https://fr.mathworks.com/help/pde/ug/deflection-analysis-of-a-bracket.html

The goal is to reduce the response of the bracket over several material properties with ML toolbox and use this as a SIMULINK block.
